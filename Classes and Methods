Classes
A class represents a single concept.
A Java program must have one class whose name is the same as the program filename.
In the example, the Person class must be declared in a program file named Person.java.

public class Person {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    System.out.println("I am a person, not a computer.");
    
  }
  
}

main() Method

In Java, every application must contain a main() method, which is the entry point for the application. All other methods are invoked from the main() method.

The signature of the method is public static void main(String[] args) { }. It accepts a single argument: an array of elements of type String.
public class Person {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    System.out.println("Hello, world!");

  }
  
}
